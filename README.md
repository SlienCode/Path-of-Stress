# Path of Stress
Path of Stress is a platformer game made in Java using the Processing library. All of the assets such as images, animations, music and sound effects are made by us and you are free to use them for non-commercial purposes only. Special thanks to Jakob Fischer for the text font used in the game.

## Technologies Used
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) for coding.

[Processing](https://processing.org/) for the implementation of graphics and sound.

[Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/gr_en/products/photoshop.html) for textures and animations.

[FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) for music and sound effects.

[VEGAS Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/) for the game trailer.

## Setting Up The Environment
You will need Processing 3 (may also be compatible with newer versions). Create a folder named "Path_of_Stress" and drop all of the .pde files and asset folders inside it. Then simply run whichever .pde file using Processing and you are set.
